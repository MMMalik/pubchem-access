# About
Pubchem-access is a light-weight module enabling communication with [PubChem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) database in JavaScript. In the browser, it is designed to work with an AMD module loader, e.g. [require.js](http://requirejs.org/) and has Ajax API [SuperAgent](https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent) as its sole dependency.
Node version coming soon.
